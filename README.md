# Prelude API (Resent Clients API for servers)

This API is the joint effort of `Preva1l` & `cire` at the request of `cire`
and is made to allow the EaglerCraft client Resent Client to have features not possible entirely on the client-side.


It also allows server owners to disable specific mods that they do not want used on their server.

## How To Use
See here: [Getting-Started](docs/Getting-Started.md)
